# Emoji Variables Demo

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the usage of emoji variables along with their Unicode representations. It also serves as a simple demo to show a variable itself and its content using the `show_line()` function.

## Overview

This Python script showcases various emoji variables along with their Unicode representations. The script includes a `show_line()` function that prints each emoji variable, its Unicode representation, and its description. This script can be used as a demo to display both the variable name and its content.

## Usage

To run the script, simply execute the `main()` function:
